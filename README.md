I'm a professional software developer for more than ten years.

In 2014 I left my job at a multinational and create MoureDev, the reflection of my dream to grow as a professional within the software development industry. Since then I have dedicated myself to specializing in mobile application development, collaborating with companies from different parts of the world, creating more than 60 Apps and founding my own startup.

In 2018 I return to my small hometown in Galicia (Spain), and I begin to create programming content and share my experience as a developer on platforms such as YouTube, Udemy and Twitch. I want to return all the knowledge that the community has shared with me for free
